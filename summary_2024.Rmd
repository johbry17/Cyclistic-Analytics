# Executive Summary

---

This report analyzes historical data on Cyclistic users to provide insights for a digital marketing campaign aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. Our findings suggest that casual riders use Cyclistic differently than members, and marketing strategies should leverage these behavioral patterns to drive conversions.

\

### Key Findings

- **Casual riders use Cyclistic for leisure:** Their rides are almost twice as long (~20 minutes) with peak traffic on weekends, particularly Saturday afternoons.

- **Annual members are predominantly commuters:** Their rides are shorter (averaging under 12 minutes) and occur mainly during weekday commuting hours (8 AM and 5 PM).

- **Location trends:** Members’ trips are concentrated in downtown Chicago’s business districts, while casual riders favor popular leisure destinations.

- **Increasing electric bike usage:** Both members and casual riders show a growing preference for electric bikes.

> <span style='font-style: italic; font-size: 14pt;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do annual members and casual riders differ in their use of Cyclistic bikes, and how can this inform marketing strategies to convert casual riders into members?</span>

#### Summary of the Business Case

Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, aims to increase its number of annual members, as they are more profitable than casual riders. Rather than targeting new customers, the marketing team wants to convert casual riders into annual members by understanding their riding behaviors.

To support this initiative, I have been assigned to analyze how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. This analysis will identify key trends in usage patterns, which will inform marketing strategies designed to encourage casual riders to become members.

## Data Cleaning and Manipulation

---

Google provided a starter [template](https://github.com/johbry17/Cyclistic-A-Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone/blob/main/resources/data_cleaning_v1.R) to clean the data, initially covering only Q1 2019 and Q1 2020. This template was significantly modified to clean all of 2024. [See full data cleaning script](https://github.com/johbry17/Cyclistic-A-Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone/blob/main/resources/data_cleaning_v3.R).

Data cleaning consisted of:

● Created columns for day, month, year, season, and day of the week to support aggregation.

● Calculated `ride_length` in minutes.

● Removed negative `ride_length` values, including company-flagged quality control rides.

● Removed duplicate rides.

● Removed outliers, conservatively dropping the longest 0.25% of rides (>4.5 hours).

● Switched to Leaflet for mapping due to the transition from station-based coordinates in 2019 to more granular bike location data, making it impossible to map single stations.

\

## Analysis

---

**Casual riders’ trips** last almost **twice as long** as members’ trips (20 minutes vs. 12 minutes).

**Members take significantly more trips overall**, with regular weekday commuting patterns.

**Trip timing differs**:

- Members peak during weekday commuting hours (8 AM & 5 PM).

- Casual riders peak on weekend afternoons.

**Trip locations differ**:

- Members primarily ride to **The Loop, River North, and key transit hubs** for commuting.

- Casual riders frequent **tourist/leisure spots** (e.g., Shedd Aquarium, Theater on the Lake).

#### Top Stations by Rider Type

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# create HTML table of top stations

# aggregate member rider counts by station
member_peak_stations <- df %>%
  filter(member_casual == "member" & start_station_name != "NA") %>%
  count(start_station_name, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(10, n)

# aggregate casual rider counts by station
casual_peak_stations <- df %>%
  filter(member_casual == "casual" & start_station_name != "NA") %>%
  count(start_station_name, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(10, n)

# style tables
member_table <- member_peak_stations %>%
  rename(Station = start_station_name, "Member Rides" = n) %>%
  select(Station, "Member Rides") %>% # exclude index
  kable("html", caption = "Top 10 Member Peak Stations") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

casual_table <- casual_peak_stations %>%
  rename(Station = start_station_name, "Casual Rides" = n) %>%
  select(Station, "Casual Rides") %>% # exclude index
  kable("html", caption = "Top 10 Casual Peak Stations") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

# CSS flexbox to align
browsable(div(
  style = "display: flex; justify-content: space-around;",
  div(style = "width: 45%;", HTML(as.character(member_table))),
  div(style = "width: 45%;", HTML(as.character(casual_table)))
))
```

This skips the top station, NA, as electric bikes commonly don't use a docking station.

## Scenario

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">[`r fa("arrow-up")` &nbsp; Back to Ask](#ask)</span>

Quoted from the Google Data Analytics Capstone (see PDF [here](https://github.com/johbry17/Cyclistic-A-Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone/blob/main/resources/Case%20Study%201_How%20does%20a%20bike-share%20navigate%20speedy%20success.pdf)):

<blockquote style="font-size: 10pt;">You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes dierently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

Characters and teams

● Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.

● Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.

● Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals—as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.

● Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

About the company

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

Note that data-privacy issues prohibit you from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This means that you won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.

Three questions will guide the future marketing program:

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Moreno has assigned you the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

You will produce a report with the following deliverables:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. A clear statement of the business task

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. A description of all data sources used

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. A summary of your analysis

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Supporting visualizations and key findings

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Your top three recommendations based on your analysis
