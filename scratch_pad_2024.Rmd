## Scratch Pad for 2024 Cyclistic Exploratory Data Analysis

<div class="button">
  <a href="summary_2024.html#analysis">Back to<br>Cyclistic 2024</a>
</div>

Exploratory Data Analysis, unencumbered by the need to be **too** presentable. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load data, combine into a df
read_cyclistic_data <- function(year) {
  for (i in 1:12) {
    month <- sprintf("%02d", i) # Format as 01, 02, ..., 12
    file_path <- paste0("resources/data/", year, "/", year, month, "-divvy-tripdata_cleaned.csv")

    if (file.exists(file_path)) {
      data <- read_csv(file_path)
      data$month <- as.character(data$month) # ensure month is character
      assign(paste0("m", month), data, envir = .GlobalEnv)
    } else {
      message("File not found: ", file_path)
    }
  }
}

read_cyclistic_data(2024)

# regex to bind rows of all monthly data frames
df <- bind_rows(mget(ls(pattern = "^m\\d{2}$")))

# dump memory
rm(list = ls(pattern = "^m\\d{2}(_cleaned)?$"))
gc()
```

Drop duplicate rows

```{r}
df %>%
  count(ride_id) %>%
  filter(n > 1)
```

```{r}
df <- df %>% distinct(ride_id, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

```{r}
df %>%
  count(ride_id) %>%
  filter(n > 1)
```

```{r}
table(df$month)
```

Reassigning the month "9" to "09".

```{r}
df$month <- sprintf("%02d", as.numeric(format(df$date, "%m")))
table(df$month)
```

Number of member vs casual rides

```{r}
table(df$member_casual)
```

3.7 million member rides vs 2.2 million casual rides. Unfortunately, there is no way to tell how many are repeat users. Presumably, many member riders repeat far more often than casual riders. The scenario puts members at 30% of Cyclistic.

In the scenario, and in real life, the data is shared without any sort of identifying information that would help track that, probably why after 2019 they removed gender and birth year. It wasn't much help anyway.

# NA stations and e-bikes
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">[`r fa("arrow-up")` &nbsp; Back to Top](#)</span>

```{r}
# NA value counts
na_counts <- sapply(df, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

# print
print(na_counts)
```

Start station counts by rideable_type

```{r}
df %>%
  mutate(missing_name = is.na(start_station_name)) %>%
  group_by(rideable_type) %>%
  summarize(missing_count = sum(missing_name), total = n(), perc_missing = mean(missing_name)) %>%
  arrange(desc(perc_missing))
```

Yup. Missing stations are electric bikes without a docking station, left randomly throughout the city.

End stations counts by rideable_type

```{r}
df %>%
  mutate(missing_name = is.na(end_station_name)) %>%
  group_by(rideable_type) %>%
  summarize(missing_count = sum(missing_name), total = n(), perc_missing = mean(missing_name)) %>%
  arrange(desc(perc_missing))
```

```{r}
known_stations <- df %>%
  filter(!is.na(start_station_id) & !is.na(start_station_name)) %>%
  select(start_station_id, start_station_name, start_lat, start_lng) %>%
  distinct()
print(count(known_stations))
```

```{r}
# attempt to consolidate known stations
known_stations <- df %>%
  filter(!is.na(start_station_id) & !is.na(start_station_name)) %>%
  mutate(
    start_lat = round(start_lat, 4), # roughly the length of a bus
    start_lng = round(start_lng, 4)
  ) %>%
  select(start_station_id, start_station_name, start_lat, start_lng) %>%
  distinct()
print(count(known_stations))
```

Stations no longer have a specific lat/lng, like in 2019. No exact station location maps anymore. Have to do heatmaps.

```{r}
# distinct start_station_name count
distinct_start_station_count <- df %>%
  summarise(distinct_count = n_distinct(start_station_name))

# print
print(distinct_start_station_count)
```
 It's supposed to be 692, per the scenario. (I found 608 in 2019).

```{r}
# distinct start_station_id count
distinct_start_station_count <- df %>%
  summarise(distinct_count = n_distinct(start_station_id))

# print
print(distinct_start_station_count)
```

So, 45 duplicate station names, probably easily explained. Easier than the extra ~1000 station id's.

Electronic bikes are a game changer. I thought switching from 2019 to 2024 was gonna be easy.

# Ride length (and NA end_lat/lng)
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">[`r fa("arrow-up")` &nbsp; Back to Top](#)</span>

IQR

```{r}
summary(df$ride_length)
```

The mean is higher than the 3rd quartile. Data set skews left. Makes sense, as many commuter rides are quick, but leisure rides can last a while. And sometimes people just dump the bike in a ditch so it appears to be a long ride.

```{r}
max(df$ride_length) / 60 / 24
```

A little over a day. Somebody forgot to dock a bike.

```{r}
print(df[which.max(df$ride_length), ])
```

Average of rides with no end lat(/lng also missing)

```{r}
# average ride_length for rows with missing end_lat
avg_ride_length_missing_end_lat <- df %>%
  filter(is.na(end_lat)) %>%
  summarise(avg_ride_length = mean(ride_length, na.rm = TRUE))

# print
print(avg_ride_length_missing_end_lat) / 60 / 24
```

A little over a day.

Min of rides with no end lat(/lng also missing)

```{r}
# minimum ride_length for rows with missing end_lat
min_ride_length_missing_end_lat <- df %>%
  filter(is.na(end_lat)) %>%
  summarise(min_ride_length = min(ride_length, na.rm = TRUE))

# print
print(min_ride_length_missing_end_lat) / 60 / 24
```

```{r}

  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "blue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +

# Ride length outliers / IQR
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">[`r fa("arrow-up")` &nbsp; Back to Top](#)</span>

Experimenting with which outliers to remove.

Note that I can toggle between these and "run all" to see the impact... and the power to skew results. Mwahahahaha!

```{r}
# IQR * 1.5 for outliers
# calculate Q1, Q3, and IQR
Q1 <- quantile(df$ride_length, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)
Q3 <- quantile(df$ride_length, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)
IQR <- Q3 - Q1

# lower and upper bounds for outliers
lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

# filter out outliers
df_no_outliers <- df %>%
  filter(ride_length >= lower_bound & ride_length <= upper_bound)

# print
summary(df_no_outliers$ride_length)
```

```{r}
# IQR * 3 for outliers
lower_bound_strict <- Q1 - 3 * IQR
upper_bound_strict <- Q3 + 3 * IQR

# filter out outliers
df_no_outliers <- df %>%
  filter(ride_length >= lower_bound_strict & ride_length <= upper_bound_strict)

# print
summary(df_no_outliers$ride_length)
```

```{r}
# remove the 99th percentile
upper_1_percent <- quantile(df$ride_length, 0.99, na.rm = TRUE)

# filter out the top 1% of the data
df_no_outliers <- df %>%
  filter(ride_length <= upper_1_percent)

# print
summary(df_no_outliers$ride_length)
```

```{r}
# the 99.5 percentile
upper_.5_percent <- quantile(df$ride_length, 0.995, na.rm = TRUE)

# filter out the top 0.5% of the data
df_no_outliers <- df %>%
  filter(ride_length <= upper_.5_percent)

# print
summary(df_no_outliers$ride_length)
```

```{r}
# the 99.75 percentile
upper_.25_percent <- quantile(df$ride_length, 0.9975, na.rm = TRUE)

# filter out the top 0.025% of the data
df_no_outliers <- df %>%
  filter(ride_length <= upper_.25_percent)

# print
summary(df_no_outliers$ride_length)
```

I will very conservatively drop the 0.25% of rides over four and a half hours long.

Members ride more frequently for shorter duration (probably commuting).

Casuals ride longer (probably leisure).

Peak in summer, unsurprisingly.

Here is where I noticed a "9" month. There were 35 rides in the month "9" instead of "09". Stuck out at 100 and 450 minute long trip durations (outliers). I fixed it up at the top.

Peak time is Saturday afternoon, followed by Sunday afternoon. But also a little around peak end-of-work hour. Are casual riders transiting in to work, and biking back?

Classic pedal bikes rides last longer. Is that because there's a bigger supply, or greater consumer preference? I bet it's because the electric ones ran out of power.

What's going on with electric_scooter there? Did they only briefly demo it in September? Or is this a categorizing error?

Note that the usage of electric bikes is upticking. Did they invest in electric bikes?
