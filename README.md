## Project Overview

**Cyclistic** is a hypothetical bikeshare company in Chicago. This project investigates differences between casual riders and annual members to support a key business goal: increase member conversions.

Using public data provided by Divvy (via Lyft), the analysis:
- Cleans and preprocesses raw CSVs from 2024 and 2019
- Explores ride patterns by time, location, and bike type
- Visualizes data with `ggplot2`, `leaflet`, and R Markdown
- Provides strategic recommendations based on real insights

Originally built as the final project for the [Google Data Analytics Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics), it follows the six-phase analytics process:

## Features

- üìÑ R Markdown reports knitted to interactive HTML
- üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Leaflet maps showing ride density by user type
- üìà Time-of-day usage patterns (hourly ride histograms)
- üìÜ Weekday vs. weekend trends by user type
- üìä Bike type and ride volume by month
- üß≠ Year-over-year comparisons to spot post-pandemic trends
- üìå Top stations mapped for casuals vs. members
- üí° Strategic recommendations for converting casual riders

## Tools & Technologies
