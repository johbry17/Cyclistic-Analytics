## Scratch Pad for 2019 Cyclistic Exploratory Data Analysis

<div class="button">
  <a href="summary_2019.html#analysis">Back to<br>Cyclistic 2019</a>
</div>

Exploratory Data Analysis, unencumbered by the need to be **too** presentable. 

```{r}
# load data, combine into df
q1_2019 <- read.csv("./resources/data/q1_2019_cleaned.csv")
q2_2019 <- read.csv("./resources/data/q2_2019_cleaned.csv")
q3_2019 <- read.csv("./resources/data/q3_2019_cleaned.csv")
q4_2019 <- read.csv("./resources/data/q4_2019_cleaned.csv")
stations <- read.csv("./resources/data/stations.csv")

df <- bind_rows(q1_2019, q2_2019, q3_2019, q4_2019)
```

Number of member vs casual rides

```{r}
table(df$member_casual)
```
3 million member rides vs 1 million casual rides. Unfortunately, there is no way to tell how many are repeat users. Presumably, many member riders repeat far more often than casual riders.

In the scenario, and in real life, the data is shared without any sort of identifying information that would help track that, probably why after 2019 they removed gender and birthyear.

!!NOTE!! - Below is where I realized that ride_length was in minutes for 2019, seconds for 2020, and had to adjust data cleaning. It has been rectified.

```{r}
summary(df$ride_length)
```
There are some ridiculously long rides.

```{r}
max(df$ride_length) / 60 / 24
```
123 days! Hell of an outlier.

```{r}
print(df[which.max(df$ride_length), ])
```

```{r}
# ggplot(df, aes(y = ride_length)) +
#   geom_boxplot() +
#   labs(title = "Boxplot of Ride Lengths",
#        y = "Ride Length (minutes)",
#        x = "") +
#   theme_minimal()
```
Kinda pointless to plot that.

Members ride more frequently for shorter duration (probably commuting).

Casuals ride longer, enough to beat members for total minutes on a bicycle.

Peak in August, unsurprisingly.

```{r}

```

February would be an outlier - very few rides were ridden that month. The law of small numbers. Small sample size bias.

Members peak with commuter hours.

Peak time is Saturday afternoon, followed by Sunday afternoon. Unsurprising.

Those two bars are weird and don't seem right. I am guessing that if I knew the geography of Chicago, the casual / member stations would be more illuminating. "Milleniumn Park", "Shedd Aquarium", "Theater on the Lake", "Dusable Harbor", and "Adler Planetarium" sound like destinations for the occasional bike rider.

Remember, this is member rides and casual rides, so member's presumably will be over respresented.

```{r}
# age distribution
ggplot(df, aes(x = 2020 - birthyear, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, alpha = 0.7, position = "dodge") +
  # stat_bin(binwidth = 5, geom = "text", aes(label = ..count..), vjust = -0.5, position = position_dodge(5)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Age Distribution by Rider Type", x = "Age", y = "Count") +
  xlim(0, 100)
```

```{r}
# gender split
ggplot(df, aes(x = gender, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  geom_text(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count..), vjust = -0.5, position = position_dodge(0.9)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Gender Breakdown by Rider Type", x = "Gender", y = "Count")
```

I went through a lot of effort to extract the age and gender data, and it might not have been worth the value-added to see that member riders are slightly older and tend to be male-dominated. Not sure this helps me launch an ad campaign.

And that was how I ended up going on to recent data, 2024...
